### Link to production site: https://www.news-scraper.com/

News Scraper is an app that allows users to provide an email address and links to their favorite blogs or news sites, and sends an email containing articles from those sites every day.  

### How to use this service 

Navigate to http://www.news-scraper.com/subscribe and enter your email address, along with links to any pages you would like to recieve articles from. Links should be full URLs separated by commas, with no spaces. After submitting the form, check your inbox for a confirmation email. Once you confirm, you will start recieving a newsletter with links to articles from the pages you listed every day at around 6:30AM Mountain Time. The service currently works best with news sites or blogs that contain links to articles, like [here](https://www.slashdot.org) or [here](https://www.bbc.com/news). Pages that have more variety in content may also work, but there would be more potential for bugs. Please submit an issue or contact me directly at msimon@uab.edu if you encounter any problems.
